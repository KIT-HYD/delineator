      Fast, accurate watershed delineation using hybrid vector- and raster-based methods and data from MERIT-Hydro.
      This is the tool-spec version of delineate.py. It runs as a docker container with data for Western Europe
      already included. You can also use the tool to download more MERIT-Hydro data and reuse the downloaded data
      for the next runs of the tool.

      outlets:
        description: | 
          A CSV or GeoJSON file of the watershed outlets. 
          The GeoJSON is the preferred format. Has to be a FeatureCollection of Point geometries.
          CSV needs at least a lon and a lat column, but accepts also an id, name and area column. 
          If area is provided, it can be used to calcualte the error of the delineation.
        extension: 
          - csv
          - geojson
        example: /in/outlets.geojson
